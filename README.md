# LJRV - LuaJIT RISC-V 64 Port

LuaJIT is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for the Lua programming language,
RISC-V is a free and open ISA enabling a new era of processor innovation.

## Introduction

LJRV is a ongoing porting project of LuaJIT to the RISC-V 64-bit architecture by PLCT Lab, ISCAS.
The ultimate goal is to provide a RISC-V 64 LuaJIT implementation and have it upstreamed to the official LuaJIT repository.

## Progress

- [x] Interpreter Runtime
  - except unwinding
- [x] JIT Compiler
  - table reference might be broken

LJRV is still of beta quality, particularly the JIT compiler.
For production usage, we suggests disable the JIT compiler during compilation by setting `XCFLAGS+= -DLUAJIT_DISABLE_JIT` in Makefile or environment variable.
